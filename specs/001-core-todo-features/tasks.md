# Tasks: Core Todo App Features

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-core-todo-features/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create `src/`, `tests/`, `src/services/`, `src/models/`, `src/cli/` directories
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python project (e.g., create `__init__.py` files in `src/`, `src/services/`, `src/models/`, `src/cli/`, `tests/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`)
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure `pytest` for testing (e.g., `pytest.ini` or basic test setup)
- [ ] T004 [P] Create `utils.py` for common utility functions in `src/services/utils.py`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T005 [P] Create `Task` entity class/dictionary structure in `src/models/task.py`
- [ ] T006 [P] Implement `Task` validation logic (e.g., `validate_task_title` to ensure non-empty) in `src/models/task.py`
- [ ] T007 [P] Create `TaskRepository` class for in-memory storage (list/dict based) in `src/services/task_repository.py`
- [ ] T008 [P] Implement `generate_unique_id` function in `src/services/utils.py`
- [ ] T009 [P] Write unit tests for `Task` entity validation in `tests/unit/test_task_model.py`
- [ ] T010 [P] Write unit tests for `generate_unique_id` in `tests/unit/test_utils.py`
- [ ] T011 [P] Write unit tests for `TaskRepository` methods (init, add, get_all) in `tests/unit/test_task_repository.py`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Update an Existing Task (Priority: P2)

- [ ] T051 Implement "Exit" option in the main menu loop in `src/cli/menu.py`
- [ ] T052 Add overall integration test for continuous menu operation and exit in `tests/integration/test_cli_main_loop.py`
- [ ] T053 Refactor and clean up code for PEP 8 compliance and type hinting enforcement

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-   **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
-   **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
-   **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
    -   User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
    -   Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
-   **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

-   **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
-   **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
-   **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
-   **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
-   **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

-   Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
-   CLI input/output handling should follow service implementation
-   Core implementation before integration

### Parallel Opportunities

-   All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
-   All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
-   Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1 and 2 can start in parallel (P1 priority)
-   Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 3, 4, and 5 can start in parallel after P1 stories (P2 priority)
-   All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
-   Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 & 2 Only)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Setup
2.  Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3.  Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4.  Complete Phase 4: User Story 2
5.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Stories 1 & 2 independently
6.  Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1.  Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2.  Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3.  Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4.  Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5.  Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6.  Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7.  Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1.  Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2.  Once Foundational is done:
    -   Developer A: User Story 1
    -   Developer B: User Story 2
    -   Developer C: User Story 3
    -   Developer D: User Story 4
    -   Developer E: User Story 5
3.  Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

-   [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
-   [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
-   Each user story should be independently completable and testable
-   Verify tests fail before implementing
-   Commit after each task or logical group
-   Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
-   Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
